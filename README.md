💻 Project Overview
This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio, designed and built to showcase my core competencies in modern web development, data architecture, and full-stack problem-solving.
Architecture & Code Structure
The entire portfolio is a multi-page static website consisting of three core files: Home.html, Projects.html, and About Me.html.
Deployment: The pages are designed to be served from a single folder and were deployed using Netlify, utilizing relative paths (./Projects.html) to maintain connectivity between the pages.
Technology Stack: The project is built using only HTML5, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. This approach demonstrates a strong foundation in core web technologies without reliance on external frameworks for structure.
Key Technical Implementations


Implementation Detail
Description
Responsive Theming
Core Code: JavaScript logic manages localStorage and toggles a dark-mode CSS class on the <body>. Custom CSS variables (--color-bg-primary, --color-accent) ensure a consistent, theme-aware palette across all elements.
Circular Wipe Transition
A custom JavaScript/CSS animation is used for the Dark/Light theme switch and page navigation, providing a highly polished, single-page-application feel to the multi-page structure.
Data Modeling
The repository includes documentation (referenced on the Projects page) demonstrating strong foundational knowledge in relational database design, specifically a fully normalized SQL schema.
API Integration Experience
The Projects page highlights experience with integrating external REST APIs (e.g., Lalamove), detailing the process of handling logistics automation and dynamic cost calculation.

📂 Featured Projects
The projects highlighted on the live site demonstrate my ability to move from abstract problem-solving to deployed solutions.
